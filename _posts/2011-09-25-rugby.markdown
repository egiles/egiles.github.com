        <p>Rugby World Cup, 2011 - Scotland vs Argentina.</p>

        <p>There are a few games played in Wellington, just too good an
        opportunity to miss, so I took Alister to see a game.  The other
        kids were quite unhappy about missing out, but it really was too
        late for them.</p>

        <p>The stadium was about 3/4 full, and it was raining cats and dogs, but
        the atmosphere really was amazing - especially from the Argentinians
        (where did they all come from?).  There was a Mexican wave running
        around the stadium in the first half, there were drums and whistles,
        and lots of singing.</p>

        <p>The rugby got quite exciting for the last few minutes of the game too -
        Argentina won 13 - 12.</p>
