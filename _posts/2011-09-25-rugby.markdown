Rugby World Cup, 2011 - Scotland vs Argentina.

There are a few games played in Wellington, just too good an
opportunity to miss, so I took Alister to see a game.  The other
kids were quite unhappy about missing out, but it really was too 
late for them.

The stadium was about 3/4 full, and it was raining cats and dogs, but 
the atmosphere really was amazing - especially from the Argentinians
(where did they all come from?).  There was a Mexican wave running
around the stadium in the first half, there were drums and whistles,
and lots of singing.

The rugby got quite exciting for the last few minutes of the game too - 
Argentina won 13 - 12.
