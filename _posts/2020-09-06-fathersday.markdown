    <p>Claire's been doing irish dancing for like, forever.  This year her dancing school
    issued a challenge to have the children teach their dad a dance, and submit the
    video of the result.</p>

    <p>We spent well over an hour one evening while she tried to teach me to do this
    dance, I kept doing my best, and at the end of each try, she'd say
    <blockquote class="blockquote"><p>That was really good, but this time....</p></blockquote></p>
    
    <p>We didn't win.</p>
