    <p>MY GRANDAD</p>

    <p>His thick greyish white hair flings itself around like a train in a hurry that has
    people just about to fall of the carriage, clinging on with all their might. His
    voice could make friends easily with his friendly tinge. When I cuddle him it makes
    me feel secure. He smells like the g's (the Giles's and the Gregan's.)</p>

    <p>He likes gardening in his separate special garden with concrete around it to stop
    the dirt coming out. He is kind and gives us lollies and lets us watch tv. His
    kindness lets him give us lunch like pizza, 2 minute noodles or just bread with
    yummy toppings.</p>

    <p>I'm always excited to go to his house. He makes me feel cared for and loved. I
    feel happy.</p>

    <p>He has 2 extra bedrooms with a friendly coldness. The wooden table is strong
    like an elephant.</p>

    <p>GRANDAD.</p>
