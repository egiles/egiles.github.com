        <p>I went for a walk up Mt Kaukau with Dan Moore, he took
        Charlotte and I took Alister.</p>

        <p>Alister really wanted me to carry him, but would rather walk
        than go in the push chair so he ended up walking most of the way up.</p>

        <p>This photo is near the top - I had just dragged him up about a
        million steps in his push chair , so we were both glad he was walking. </p>
