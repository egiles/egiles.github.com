I went for a walk up Mt Kaukau with Dan Moore, he took
Charlotte and I took Alister.

Alister really wanted me to carry him, but would rather walk
than go in the push chair so he ended up walking most of the way up.

This photo is near the top - I had just dragged him up about a
million steps in his push chair , so we were both glad he was walking.
