Snow? In Wellington?!

I don't think it is that Wellington is too warm for snow, just that... It 
doesn't happen, or at least if it does, we get a quick flurry that is gone
before it even settles on the ground.

But today, it snowed for a couple of hours - even in the city (which is at 
sea level).

Very exciting.
