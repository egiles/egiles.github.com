        <p>Snow? In Wellington?!</p>

        <p>I don't think it is that Wellington is too warm for snow, just that... It
        doesn't happen, or at least if it does, we get a quick flurry that is gone
        before it even settles on the ground.</p>

        <p>But today, it snowed for a couple of hours - even in the city (which is at
        sea level).</p>

        <p>Very exciting.</p>
