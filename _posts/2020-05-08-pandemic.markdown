title: Family sport challenge
---
The world has been in lockdown due to the covid19 pandemic, during all this, Sonia's
Family have been doing weekly online video conferencing... and each week they have
been issueing challenges.

This week we did a sport challenge, so we decided to climb Mt Kaukau every day.  We
took a quick video at the top each day and this is the result.

If you look closely, you can see that even though we all climbed up a couple of times,
only Claire did it every day.
