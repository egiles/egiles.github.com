        <p>For a long time Alister has been wanting a chance to win something
        - Claire gets quite a lot of oppurtunity with her dancing, but he
        hasn't really had much of a chance.</p>

        <p>So when Mum wanted to enter him into a "competitions society" music
        competition in Gisborne, we thought it would be a great idea.</p>

        <p>He entered 3 categories in the under 10 years age group, a total of
        about 5 minutes playing time (and 2 days driving time).  We had no
        idea what standard the other kids would be playing at - and some of
        them would be a year older than him...</p>

        <p>The competition lasted several days, we watched quite a bit of the
        other stuff that was going on, and gradually over a period of several
        days... </p>

        <p>...HE WON ALL 3 CATEGORIES.  It was very exciting!</p>
