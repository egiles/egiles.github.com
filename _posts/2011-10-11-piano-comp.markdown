For a long time Alister has been wanting a chance to win something
- Claire gets quite a lot of oppurtunity with her dancing, but he
hasn't really had much of a chance.

So when Mum wanted to enter him into a "competitions society" music
competition in Gisborne, we thought it would be a great idea.

He entered 3 categories in the under 10 years age group, a total of
about 5 minutes playing time (and 2 days driving time).  We had no
idea what standard the other kids would be playing at - and some of
them would be a year older than him...

The competition lasted several days, we watched quite a bit of the 
other stuff that was going on, and gradually over a period of several
days... 

...HE WON ALL 3 CATEGORIES.  It was very exciting!
