        <p>A beautiful day in the middle of winter,
        so we decided to go fishing dwon by Frank Kitts park, and ended
        up catching quite a few little fish really quickly.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, once we caught them they had to be dispatched, and
        all the kids watched really intently as the little fish went from
        alive to.... not alive.</p>

        <p>Since then Billy has been very careful about where his food comes
        from, and "where are the eyes", and "is meat really a cow"...</p>
