A beautiful day in the middle of winter,
so we decided to go fishing dwon by Frank Kitts park, and ended 
up catching quite a few little fish really quickly.

Unfortunately, once we caught them they had to be dispatched, and
all the kids watched really intently as the little fish went from
alive to.... not alive.

Since then Billy has been very careful about where his food comes
from, and "where are the eyes", and "is meat really a cow"...
