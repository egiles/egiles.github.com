I took Alister and Billy tramping with Dan and his girls over Queens Birthday
weekend.  We went into the Orongorongos.

It was a pretty easy walk which is supposed to take less than two hours, but
it took us three.  That is fair enough considering the age of the children.

Everyone had a pretty good time, but:
* Alister fell off the bunk in the hut and hurt his toe
* Billy fell into the river 

Billy ended up cold, and Alister limped all the way home.  I didn't give him a
lot of sympathy, so I felt quite guilty when the bruising came out after we 
got home.  A quick trip to the doctor reassured us that it wasn't broken, so
we can count it as a sucessful trip.
