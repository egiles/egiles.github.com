  I took Alister and Billy tramping with Dan and his girls over Queens Birthday
  weekend.  We walked the Orongorong track.

  It was a pretty easy walk which is supposed to take less than two hours, but
  it took us three.  That is fair enough considering the age of the children.

  Everyone had a pretty good time, but:
  * Alister fell off the bunk in the hut and hurt his toe
  * Billy fell into the river

  Billy ended up cold, and Alister limped all the way home.  I didn't give him a
  lot of sympathy, so I felt quite guilty when the bruising came out after we
  got home.  A quick trip to the doctor reassured us that it wasn't broken, so
  we can count it as a sucessful trip.
