        <p>I took Alister and Billy tramping with Dan and his girls over Queens Birthday
        weekend.  We went into the Orongorongos.</p>

        <p>It was a pretty easy walk which is supposed to take less than two hours, but
        it took us three.  That is fair enough considering the age of the children.</p>

        <p>Everyone had a pretty good time, but:
        * Alister fell off the bunk in the hut and hurt his toe
        * Billy fell into the river </p>

        <p>Billy ended up cold, and Alister limped all the way home.  I didn't give him a
        lot of sympathy, so I felt quite guilty when the bruising came out after we
        got home.  A quick trip to the doctor reassured us that it wasn't broken, so
        we can count it as a sucessful trip.</p>
